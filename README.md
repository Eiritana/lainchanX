This is a small 8chan userscript, it adds various features and options like:
 * Post and image counts
 * Image expansion on hover (threads and catalog)
 * Relative post dates (n minutes/hours/days ago)
 * Integration with the 8chan Options menu
 * Reveal text and image spoilers
 * Use catalog links by default in the menu
 
Additionally, this fork adds:
 * Thread page display on the catalog and in the menu status area
 * Visible autosage on the catalog and in the menu status area
 * Reverse image search links
 * Many other poorly written hacks
 * Slightly less dead than tux's version
